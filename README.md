ntroduction 

The theory of flexible accelerator has been developed in various forms by Seneri, Goodwin, Koik and Junankar.

But the most accepted approach was adopted by Koik.

This theory is also known as the capital stock adjustment model.
Meaning 

The flexible accelerator theory eliminates one of the main weaknesses of the simple acceleration theory, namely that the capital reserve is adjusted optimally without any delay.

In a flexible accelerator, there are lags in the adjustment process between the level of production and the level of capital stock.

Junankar has discussed the lags in the adjustment between production and capital stock. He explains them at the organizational level and extends them to the overall level
 If the demand for the product has increased:
Decision-making lag:

The company will use its inventory and then use its capital reserves more intensively.

If the increase in demand for production is large and lasts for some time, the company will increase the demand for capital reserves. 
Administrative lag 

organizing the capital.
 Financial resilience 

 Raising funds to buy capital

Distribution regression between formalizing capital and its distribution.

"Assuming that different companies have different results and have a distribution regression, the effect of the increase in demand on capital stocks on the whole is distributed over time. This implies that the capital stock is dependent on all previous production conditions.
